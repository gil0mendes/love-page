## Developing

To install dependencies use `npm install` and start a development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
pnpm run dev -- --open
```

## Deploying

Deploy is being made via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to simplify infrastructure management and our CD pipeline.


> You can preview the built app with `pnpm run preview`. This isn't used to serve the app in production.
